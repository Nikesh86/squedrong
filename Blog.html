            <h1>GHOREPANI POONHILL TREK</h1>
            <p>Ghorepani Poonhill Trek is one of the most popular treks in Nepal also known as Ghorepani Trek or
                Poonhill
                Trek or Mini Annapurna Trek. This low-altitude trek enables to enjoy the breath-taking scenery of the
                highest Himalayan peaks in the Annapurna mountain range. From the terraced rice-fields above Pokhara,
                there
                are good walking trails through picturesque Gurung villages and the world's biggest rhododendron
                (national
                flower of Nepal) forest, which in spring bursts with colors and birds. The highest point of this trek is
                Poon Hill (3200m), from where opens beautiful dawn view to Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchare and Annapurna
                South.
                This short trek finishes to the magnificent lake at Pokhara, where can spend one or two days enjoying
                the
                lake views.
            </p>

            <p>Ghorepani Poonhill Trek offers good opportunity to enjoy the beauty of Annapurna region with shorter
                trek.
                This trek can be done in 6 days, but also with longer itinerary. This trek won't require much strong
                physical activity or fast walking speed. Therefore this trek is good for starters and those who wish to
                make
                short but comprehensive trek only in a few days.

            <h3>WHAT TO EXPECT</h3>

            <p>Best Time to Travel:
                The best time for trekking to Ghorepani Poonhill Trek is during spring (March to May) and autumn
                (September
                to November). The temperature is moderate and guarantees amazing views throughout the trip. Although
                this
                trek can be undertaken during winter, the cold temperature might not be suitable for everyone.
            </p>

            <p>Accommodation:
                We will be staying at 2/3 star hotel in Kathmandu, and in tea-houses during the trek. All rooms are on
                twin-shared basis. Single bedroom will be arranged on request and will cost additional. Fourteen Summit
                will
                arrange rooms with attached washrooms; however, tea-houses at some places only have shared washing and
                toilet facilities. Also note that single rooms are readily available in Kathmandu and in trekking
                regions at
                lower elevation but it might be difficult to find them at higher altitude.
            </p>

            <p>Physical Condition & Experience Requirements:
                Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek is a moderate trek. Travelers who can walk up to 4-5 hours a day on an uphill
                and
                downhill trail will consider this trip fulfilling and enjoyable. It is a good idea to prepare for the
                trek
                by jogging and exercising regularly at least for a month prior to the start. Trekking to the Ghorepani
                should be relatively easy for those who have experience in walking/trekking in high altitudes.
                Determination, good physical health, positive attitude and average physical fitness are good
                preconditions
                for a successful accomplishment of the trek. Participants with pre-existing medical conditions such as
                heart, lung, and blood diseases should inform Fourteen Summit before booking the trek.
            </p>

            <p>Meals:
                All meals will be provided during trekking (On demand, we can arrange only breakfast during the trek and
                trekkers can order lunch and dinner individually from the tea-house menu). In Kathmandu, breakfast will
                be
                available. There will also be welcome and farewell dinners taking place for guests. While on trek, we
                have
                breakfast and dinner in the tea-houses/lodges where we spend the night and lunch on our way to next
                destination. Authentic Nepalese, Tibetan, continental meals and Indian cuisine are common choices in the
                menu.
